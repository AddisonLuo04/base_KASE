## Description of Problem Domain

Our team focuses on the intersecting domain of accessibility, communication, and education. 
Today, there is still a significant communication barrier between individuals who use sign language 
as those who do not understand sign language. 
There are a significant amount of individuals who do not understand sign language but would like
to learn. However, learning sign language proves to be a challenging task due to the lack of 
interactive and user-friendly resources, 
This project seeks to allow and motivate more individuals to learn sign language by developing 
an application that translate text input into corresponding sign language gestures. Not only will 
this take steps to solve the communication barrier but also provide an engaging method for 
individuals to learn and understand sign language.
