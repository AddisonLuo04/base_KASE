## Description of Problem Domain

Our team focuses on the intersecting domain of accessibility, communication, and education. 
Today, there is still a significant communication barrier between individuals who use sign language 
as those who do not understand sign language. 
There are a significant amount of individuals who do not understand sign language but would like
to learn. However, learning sign language proves to be a challenging task due to the lack of 
interactive and user-friendly resources.  

This project seeks to allow and motivate more individuals to learn sign language by developing 
an application that translate text input into corresponding sign language gestures. Moreover, 
this application will also take in speech input, translate it to text, and then display the 
corresponding sign language gesture. Not only will this take steps to solve the communication 
barrier but also provide an engaging method for individuals to learn and understand sign language.

## Description of Application 

Our team is developing an application designed to bridge the communication gap between 
individuals who use sign language and those who do not. This application will serve 
as a interactive and engaging platform for learning and understanding sign language. 


The core functionalities of the application:

- Translating text input into corresponding sign language gestures displayed through YouTube videos.
- Creating personalized lessons for new users based on their learning goals and current knowledge 
of Sign Language. 

The user interface will be designed to ensure accessibility and ease-of-use for all users. 
The application uses OpenAI API to create personalized lesson plans along with 
the YouTube API to provide a vast library of sign language gesture videos.

In essence, our application acts as an interpreter and teacher, translating written words into sign 
language through relevant video content and providing unique lessons tailored to each user. 
Additionally, it serves as an educational tool that enables users to learn sign language 
at their own pace .

We believe this solution has potential to increase communication 
and promote inclusivity for deaf and hard-of-hearing communities while offering an 
easy-to-use method for individuals interested in learning sign language.
